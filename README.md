## 🧠 About Me

I’m an aspiring software engineer and changemaker from Cambodia, committed to making tech more **inclusive**, **accessible**, and **responsible**. I co-founded [**Wander in Tech**](#) to mentor youth in STEM, reaching 500+ students. I'm also deeply interested in **AI ethics**, **machine learning**, and **global development**.

Currently:
- 🌱 Strengthening my foundations in software engineering, OOP, and algorithmic thinking
- 🔬 Exploring stochastic processes and formal verification in research
- 💡 Building *Cultura*, an app for cultural learning, for the [Apple Swift Student Challenge](#)
- 🔧 Leading ACM events around computing, careers, and community

## 🌟 Fun Fact

I started in tech by creating websites to amplify unheard voices and now mentor others to do the same. You’ll catch me building things with a matcha in hand, journaling in 3 languages, or organizing workshops about AI, ethics, and equity.
